        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The first aircraft to fly supersonically in level flight was the
          American Bell X-1 experimental plane which was powered by a 6000-lb
          thrust rocket powered by liquid oxygen and ethyl alcohol. The majority
          of supersonic aircraft have been military or experimental aircraft.

        <p>
          In the 1960s and '70s, many design studies for supersonic airliners
          were done and eventually two types entered service, the Soviet Tupolev
          Tu-144 (1968) and Anglo-French Concorde (1969). However political,
          environmental and economic obstacles and one fatal Concorde crash
          prevented them from being used to their full commercial potential.
